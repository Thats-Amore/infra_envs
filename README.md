This repo contains a minimal example of using Terragrunt to re-use the same Terraform modules in different environments/accounts.

The `terragrunt.hcl` files include all inputs further up the directory tree so that you don't have to redefine everything multiple times.

This is a stripped down example and does not include all the necessary boilerplate.
